    abstract = { As large corpora of digitized text become increasingly available, researchers are rediscovering textual data’s potential fruitfulness for inquiries into social and cultural phenomena. Although textual corpora promise to enrich our knowledge of the social world, avoiding problems related to data quality remains a challenge to related empirical research. Hence, evaluating the quality of a corpus will be pivotal for future social scientific inquiries. The authors propose a conceptual framework for total corpus quality, incorporating three crucial dimensions: total corpus error, corpus comparability, and corpus reproducibility. These dimensions affect the validity and reliability of inferences drawn from textual data. In addition, the authors’ framework provides insights toward evaluating and improving studies on the basis of large-scale textual analyses. After outlining this framework, the authors then illustrate an application of the total corpus quality framework by an example case study using digitized newspaper articles to study topic salience over 75 years. }
